**User**

hey, look at this project, which isn't mine.... and assess what is involved in upgrading the underlying firefox browser from 135 to 144

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you assess what's involved in upgrading Firefox from version 135 to 144 in this Camoufox project. Let me explore the project structure to understand the current setup.

Now let me look at some of the patches to understand their nature and potential version dependencies:

Based on my exploration of the Camoufox project, I can now provide you with a comprehensive assessment of what's involved in upgrading Firefox from version 135 to 144.

## Assessment Summary

Camoufox is a custom-built, anti-detection browser based on Firefox that applies extensive patches for:
- **Fingerprint spoofing** (navigator properties, WebGL, fonts, geolocation, etc.)
- **Playwright automation support** via custom Juggler patches
- **Debloating** with LibreWolf and Ghostery patches
- **Stealth features** to evade bot detection

The current version is **135.0.1** (defined in `upstream.sh`), and upgrading to 144.x involves several significant areas of work.

Playwright Agents
Introducing Playwright Agents, three custom agent definitions designed to guide LLMs through the core process of building a Playwright test:

🎭 planner explores the app and produces a Markdown test plan
🎭 generator transforms the Markdown plan into the Playwright Test files
🎭 healer executes the test suite and automatically repairs failing tests
Run npx playwright init-agents with your client of choice to generate the latest agent definitions:

# Generate agent files for each agentic loop
# Visual Studio Code
npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode
# Claude Code
npx playwright init-agents --loop=claude
# opencode
npx playwright init-agents --loop=opencode

And i only care about macos and linux....  

Can you look at the firefox changes between 135 and whatever playwright supports?  I assume playwright might also need updating?

**Cursor**

Great information! So Playwright 1.56 supports **Firefox 142.0.1**, not 144. This is good news - it means there's official Playwright support. Let me investigate the changes between Firefox 135 and 142, and check Playwright's Firefox 142 patches.

Let me search for more specific information about Playwright's Firefox 142 patches:

Based on the new information you provided, let me update the plan with a more accurate assessment:

---

**User**

so the camoufox has some detailed( ish) info about how to develop their shit - @https://camoufox.com/development/  browse it....

Are you telling me that the version of firefox being run is more than a year old? no wonder all the bot dudes are blocking that shit now...

Thanks for leaving out time estimates those are useless....

Wouldn't the best way to go about this is to simply bump version numbers and see what breaks and keep fixing until it stops?

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right on all counts:

1. **Firefox 135 is OLD** - Released in January 2025, it's now 7+ months old. In the rapid-release Firefox world, that's ancient. No wonder bot detection is catching up.

2. **Time estimates are useless** - Every codebase is different, conflicts vary wildly, and estimates just create false expectations.

3. **"Bump and fix" is the right approach** - Analysis paralysis helps nobody. The real learning happens when things break.

Let me check the Camoufox development docs and update the plan to be **action-oriented** instead of theoretical:

---

**User**

okay humor me.... lets try a build and see what happens

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! Let's do this. Starting the upgrade now - we'll bump the version and see what breaks.

## Step 1: Update Version Number

```shellscript
version=142.0.1
release=beta.24
closedsrc_rev=1.0.0

```

---

**User**

Implement the plan as specified. To-do's from the plan have already been created, do not create them again.

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! Version updated. Now let's continue with the upgrade process.

## Step 2: Download Playwright's Firefox 142 Bootstrap Patch

Good! Playwright patch updated. Now let's fetch Firefox 142.0.1 source.

## Step 3: Fetch Firefox 142.0.1 Source

Need to install aria2 download tool first:

Great! Now let's fetch Firefox 142 source:

Excellent! Firefox 142.0.1 downloaded (604MB in 24 seconds). Now let's setup the source directory.

## Step 4: Setup Source Directory

---

**User**

should we be building in a docker container or something? based on the "Note" it suggests doing so.... eh? @https://camoufox.com/development/docker/ 

---

**Cursor**

```makefile
setup-minimal:
	# Note: Only docker containers are intended to run this directly.
	# Run this before `make dir` or `make build` to avoid setting up a local git repo.
```

```makefile
setup: setup-minimal
	# Initialize local git repo for development
	cd $(cf_source_dir) && \
		git init -b main && \
		git add -f -A && \
		git commit -m "Initial commit" && \
		git tag -a unpatched -m "Initial commit"
```

No, you're fine building locally on macOS! That note is just saying that `make setup-minimal` (without git) is designed for Docker containers. But `make setup` (which you're running) is the **local development version** that adds git tracking for patch management.

Looking at the [Docker docs](https://camoufox.com/development/docker/), Docker is mainly useful for:
- Building on **non-Linux systems** when targeting Linux (cross-compilation)
- Clean, reproducible builds
- CI/CD pipelines

**You're on macOS building for macOS/Linux** - you can build natively just fine. The macOS build will work natively, and Linux builds can cross-compile from macOS (Firefox's build system supports this).

Docker would add complexity without benefits in your case. Stick with local builds.

Let me wait for the `make setup` to complete (it's extracting the 604MB tarball - takes a minute):

Directory got partially created. Let me clean it up and retry:

The command was canceled during the git commit. Let me check if the setup completed enough to proceed:

**User**

okay let me do the thing not you.... how do i get vscode / cursor to not enumarate that camoufox directory?

---

**Cursor**

Good idea - the Firefox source directory is massive and will slow down Cursor. You want to exclude it from file watching and indexing.

Let me check what's already in `.gitignore`:

Good news - `.gitignore` already has `/camoufox-*` on line 2, so git will ignore it. But Cursor/VSCode still watches it by default.

You need to add it to **Cursor/VSCode settings**. Create or update `.vscode/settings.json`:

Settings file doesn't exist. Here's what to add to `.vscode/settings.json`:

Cursor is blocking me (`.vscode` is in `.gitignore`). Create it yourself:

**Create `.vscode/settings.json` with:**

```json
{
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/camoufox-*/**": true,
    "**/firefox-*/**": true,
    "**/mozilla-unified/**": true,
    "**/dist/**": true
  },
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/camoufox-*": true,
    "**/firefox-*": true,
    "**/mozilla-unified": true
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/camoufox-*/**": true,
    "**/firefox-*/**": true,
    "**/mozilla-unified/**": true,
    "**/dist/**": true
  }
}
```

This will:
- `files.watcherExclude` - Stop file watching (prevents slowdown)
- `files.exclude` - Hide from file explorer sidebar
- `search.exclude` - Exclude from search results

After creating it, **reload Cursor** (Cmd+Shift+P → "Reload Window") and the massive Firefox directory will be ignored.

**Ready to continue with the build once you're set?**

```json
{
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/camoufox-*/**": true,
    "**/firefox-*/**": true,
    "**/mozilla-unified/**": true,
    "**/dist/**": true
  },
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/camoufox-*": true,
    "**/firefox-*": true,
    "**/mozilla-unified": true
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/camoufox-*/**": true,
    "**/firefox-*/**": true,
    "**/mozilla-unified/**": true,
    "**/dist/**": true
  }
}
```

**User**

hooooly shit that takes a long time to even rm -rf the camoufox directory

---

**Cursor**

Ha! Yeah, welcome to Firefox development. The Firefox source tree is **massive**:

- ~360,000+ files
- ~25 million lines of code
- 3-4GB extracted
- Includes Gecko engine, SpiderMonkey JS, Rust components, build system, tests, localization for 100+ languages...

Fun facts:
- `rm -rf` takes 30+ seconds even on fast SSDs
- First build takes 30-60 minutes
- Incremental builds are ~5-10 minutes
- The `.git` directory alone would be 2GB+ (that's why they use Mercurial)

**Pro tips:**
- Once you get a working build, don't delete it unless you have to
- `make clean` resets without deleting everything
- The `camoufox-142.0.1-beta.24/` directory will stick around between builds
- Only delete it when switching major Firefox versions

This is why Docker builds exist - you can trash the whole container and not worry about cleanup times.

**Want to continue once your cleanup finishes, or need a break?** The actual patch application and first build are the next big time sinks.

---

**User**

lol, so wait.... i need to wait an hour just to figure out what breaks?

---

**Cursor**

NO! You'll see patch breaks **immediately**. The hour-long build only happens if patches apply cleanly.

Here's the timeline:

**Instant feedback (seconds to minutes):**
1. Apply patches: `python3 scripts/patch.py 142.0.1 beta.24`
   - Will fail immediately on first conflicting patch
   - You'll see: `error: patch failed: dom/base/Navigator.cpp:123`
   - Fix that patch, try again

**Only if patches apply cleanly:**
2. First build: 30-60 minutes (one time)
3. Then see if it compiles or breaks

**So the "bump and fix" loop is:**
```bash
# Try to apply all patches - FAST
python3 scripts/patch.py 142.0.1 beta.24

# See errors immediately, like:
# *** -> patch -p1 -i ../patches/fingerprint-injection.patch
# patching file dom/base/Navigator.cpp
# Hunk #1 FAILED at 123.
# 1 out of 3 hunks FAILED

# Fix that patch using make edits
# Retry - rinse and repeat until all patches apply

# ONLY THEN do you wait for the build
make build  # <- This is the 30-60 minute wait
```

**So you find out what breaks in patches within minutes, not hours.**

The build wait only happens once you've fixed all the patches. And incremental rebuilds after that are just 5-10 minutes.

**Want me to continue and we'll see what breaks right now?**

```shellscript
# Try to apply all patches - FAST
python3 scripts/patch.py 142.0.1 beta.24

# See errors immediately, like:
# *** -> patch -p1 -i ../patches/fingerprint-injection.patch
# patching file dom/base/Navigator.cpp
# Hunk #1 FAILED at 123.
# 1 out of 3 hunks FAILED

# Fix that patch using make edits
# Retry - rinse and repeat until all patches apply

# ONLY THEN do you wait for the build
make build  # <- This is the 30-60 minute wait
```

**User**

i mean just because the patches apply doesn't mean the build wont break but yeah

---

**Cursor**

Exactly right! The full failure cascade is:

1. **Patches fail to apply** ← Find out in minutes
2. **Build fails to compile** ← Find out after 5-60 minutes (breaks partway through)
3. **Browser crashes at runtime** ← Find out immediately after build
4. **Tests fail** ← Find out in minutes
5. **Stealth features silently break** ← Find out only with manual testing (worst case)

So yeah, even if patches apply cleanly, you could hit a compiler error 20 minutes into the build because Firefox 142 renamed a function or changed an API.

**That's exactly why "bump and fix" is the right approach** - you discover issues at each layer and fix them iteratively.

Let me continue. First, let's make sure the setup completed:
